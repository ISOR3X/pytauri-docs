# Getting started

Currently, there are three ways of getting started with PyTauri:

1. Precompiled wheel: Develop with PyTauri without having to install Rust.
2. Tauri plugin: Use PyTauri as a plugin for Tauri.
3. Starting templates: Templates are the fastest way to get started with PyTauri.

Precompiled wheels are the best choice if you just want to use PyTauri for it's IPC mechanisms. If you need a bit more
customizability, using PyTauri as a Tauri plugin allows using Tauri's complete API and Rust for your performance needs.
PyO3 could even be used for more interaction between Rust and Python.  
The starting templates are a great choice if you need something more opinionated.

## Precompiled wheel

While PyTauri is build on top of Tauri, a precompiled wheel is supplied to allow using PyTauri without having to install
Rust.

The documentation is still a work in progress. Return at a later date!  
The old documentation for this section can be found [here.](https://pytauri.github.io/pytauri/dev/usage/pytauri-wheel/)

## Tauri plugin

If you also want to use Rust during development, you can set up a Tauri project and install the PyTauri plugin to use
both Python and Rust in your application.

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [create-tauri-app](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app)
- [tauri-cli](https://v2.tauri.app/reference/cli/)

### Setup wizard

PyTauri is a wrapper for Tauri, hence Tauri has to be installed first. Tauri can be installed with:

::: code-group

```sh [npm]
$ npm create tauri-app@latest
```

:::

::: info PACKAGE MANAGERS
While npm is used as a package manager for setting up the Tauri app, others can be used.
:::

This will guide you through installing and setting up a Tauri app:

<<< @/snippets/init.ansi

After `create-tauri-app` has complete you can navigate into your projectâ€™s folder, install dependencies, then use the
[Tauri CLI](https://tauri.app/reference/cli/) to start the development server as seen above.

## Starting templates

- **Vue**  
  If you plan on using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as a frontend framework, you can use
  this [pytauri-vue-starter](https://github.com/ISOR3X/pytauri-vue-starter) to get started immediately with development.

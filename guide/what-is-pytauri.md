# What is PyTauri?

PyTauri is a Python wrapper for [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), allowing you to build native applications using any modern
web-framework in combination with the power of Python.
While Tauri is build in Rust, no Rust knowledge is required!

## Use cases

- **For the Pythoneer**  
  PyTauri can be used as an alternative to [PyWebView](https://github.com/r0x0r/pywebview)
  or [PyStray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray), leveraging Tauri's comprehensive features to offer Python
  developers a GUI framework and a batteries-included
  development experience similar to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  and [PySide](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/index.html).
- **For the Rustacean**  
  Thanks to [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/), Rust developers can better utilize the vast python ecosystem. Although Rust's
  lifetime and ownership system make code safer and performant, Python's garbage collection can sometimes make the life
  of a developer easier.
